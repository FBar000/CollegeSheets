# CollegeSheets

Tools for creating Google Sheets functions to fetch data from the US government College Scorecards.

## Description

Google Sheets allows users to define their own functions with JavaScript via AppsScript, Google's online IDE. This program allows users to easily define functions in that environment that fetch data from the college scorecard API.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python >= 3

### Installation

* Clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/FBar000/CollegeSheets.git
```

### Executing program

#### Step 0: Get College Scorecard API Access token

* Visit [the documentation for the college scorecard API](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/)
* Follow the instructions for an API key under <b>API Documentation > Register for an APIkey</b>
* Paste this key in the A2 cell of the Google Sheet that will be calling data from the API

#### Step 1: Initializing AppsScript IDE for a project

* Navigate to the Google Sheet on which you want to create programs
* In the sheet, navigate to AppsScript via <b>Extensions > Apps Script </b>
* Copy the contents of `helperFunctions.js` into a Script file


#### Step 2: Creating functions with `makeJScode.py`

* Open this repo in a python IDE
* If using a new file as shown, import `makeJScode.py`
* Run `makeFunction(functionName, APIField)`, feeding as parameters the desired name of the generated function and the API field that it will access. 
For a complete list of the API fields you may access, [see the sheets ending in "_Data_Dictionary" on the "College Score Card Dictionary" spreadsheet](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/#:~:text=All%20variables%20are%20listed%20in%20the%20Data%20Dictionary). (Functions generated by this program call the latest available data.)
* Copy the outputs into script files in AppsScript
